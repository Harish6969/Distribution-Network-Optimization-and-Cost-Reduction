AnyLogistix Supply Chain Network Optimization Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and optimization of a supply chain network using AnyLogistix software. By applying Greenfield Analysis (GFA), we evaluated the distribution network for two productsâ€”sweatshirts and t-shirtsâ€”across multiple suppliers and customers in the U.S. The analysis identifies optimal distribution center placements, simulates disruptions, and provides cost-effective and efficient supply chain strategies.
